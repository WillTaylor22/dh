<h2>4. PURPOSE OF THE SITE AND SITE SERVICES.</h2>

<p>The Site is a marketplace where Employers and Drivers can identify each other and buy and sell Driver Services online. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Driver Hunt provides the Site Services to Employers and Drivers, including hosting and maintaining the Site, enabling the formation of Service Contracts, and managing disputes related to those Service Contracts. If a Employer and Driver agree on terms of the Driver Services, a Service Contract is formed directly between such Employer and Driver, subject to the provisions set forth in Section 5 (Relationship Between Employer and Driver). When Employer and Driver enter a Service Contract, they use the Site to hire, manage, and pay online.</p>


<h2>5. CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN Employer AND Driver.</h2>

<h3>5.1 Service Contracts</h3>

<p>Employer and Driver acknowledge and agree that when Driver applies a Job presented by Employer, Employer and Driver will be deemed to have entered into a "Service Contract". The Driver is obliged to make themselves available for contact, but is not legally obliged to work - the responsibility for ensuring a transition from "contact" to "employee" resides with the Employer, not Driver Hunt.</p>


<h2>6. PAYMENT TERMS.</h2>

<h3>6.1   Service Fee.</h3>

<p>When a Employer buys contact details from a Driver, Driver Hunt charges a Finders Fee that Driver Hunt earns and Employer agrees to pay Driver Hunt for creating, hosting, maintaining, and providing the Site Services. If Driver Hunt is paid in foreign currency, Driver Hunt adds a conversion fee of 1.5% to the spot rate quoted.</p>

<h3>6.4   Non-payment.</h3>

<p>If Employer fails to pay the Finders Fees or any other amounts due under this Agreement, whether by cancelling Employer's credit or debit card, initiating an improper chargeback, or any other means, Driver Hunt may suspend or terminate Employer's Account, the processing of any additional payments, and any Driver Services in progress. Without limiting other available remedies, Employer must pay Driver Hunt upon demand for amounts owed under this Agreement, plus interest on the outstanding amount at the lesser of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month or the maximum interest allowed by applicable law, plus attorneys' fees and other costs of collection to the extent permitted by applicable law. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Driver Hunt, at our discretion, may set off amounts due against other amounts received from or held by Driver Hunt for Employer, make appropriate reports to credit reporting agencies and law enforcement authorities, and cooperate with credit reporting agencies and law enforcement authorities in any resulting investigation or prosecution.</p>

<h3>6.5   No Return of Funds.</h3>

<p>Employer acknowledges and agrees that We will charge Employer's designated Payment Method for the Finders Fees: (a) for Finders Fees. Therefore, and in consideration of the Site Services provided by Driver Hunt and the escrow services provided by EEC, Employer agrees that once We charge Employer's designated Payment Method for the Finders Fees as provided in this Agreement, the charge is non-refundable, except as otherwise required by applicable law. Employer also acknowledges and agrees that this Agreement provides a dispute resolution process as a way for Employer resolve disputes. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Employer therefore agrees not to ask its credit card company, bank, or other Payment Method provider to charge back any Finders Fees or other Fees charged pursuant to this Agreement for any reason. A chargeback in breach of the foregoing obligation is a material breach of this Agreement. If Employer initiates a chargeback in violation of this Agreement, Employer agrees that Driver Hunt or EEC may dispute or appeal the chargeback and institute collection action against Employer.</p>

<h3>6.6   Formal Invoices and Taxes.</h3>

<p>Driver Hunt shall have no responsibility for determining the necessity of or for issuing any formal invoices, or for determining, remitting, or withholding any taxes applicable to the Finders Fees. Emplyers shall be solely responsible for determining whether it is required by applicable law to issue any formal invoices for the Finders Fees and for issuing any invoices so required. Employers shall also be solely responsible for determining whether Employers or Driver Hunt is required by applicable law to remit to the appropriate authorities any value added tax or any other taxes or similar charges applicable to the Finders Fees and remitting any such taxes or charges to the appropriate authorities on behalf of itself or Driver Hunt, as appropriate</p>

<p>In the event of an audit of Driver Hunt, Employers agrees to promptly cooperate with Driver Hunt and provide copies of Driver's tax returns and other documents as may be reasonably requested for purposes of such audit, including but not limited to records showing the Driver is engaging in an independent business as represented to Driver Hunt.</p>

<h3>6.7   Payment Methods.</h3>

<p>In order to use certain Site Services, Employer must provide account information for at least one valid Payment Method. The Site makes the following methods of payment available: credit cards, debit cards, and PayPal.</p>

<p>The Employer hereby authorize Driver Hunt to run credit card authorizations on all credit cards provided by the Employer to store credit card details as the Employer's method of payment for Services, and to charge the Employer's credit card (or any other form of payment authorized by Driver Hunt or mutually agreed to between the Employer and Driver Hunt). Driver Hunt does not store sensitive credit card information - this is processed by a secure 3rd party. Credit cards and PayPal accounts in most countries will be charged by Driver Hunt. Notwithstanding the foregoing, credit cards and PayPal accounts in Australia, Canada, the Eurozone, and the United Kingdom will be charged by Driver Hunt.</p>

<p>When the Employer authorizes the payment of the Finders Fees, the Employer automatically and irrevocably authorizes and instructs Driver Hunt to charge the Employer's Payment Method for the Finders Fees. Driver Hunt may deviate from the typical billing cycle and charge the Employer for any outstanding invoices at any time.</p>

<p>By providing Payment Method information through the Site, the Employer represents, warrants, and covenants that: (a) the Employer is legally authorized to provide such information to us; (b) the Employer is legally authorized to perform payments using the Payment Method(s); and (c) such action does not violate the terms and conditions applicable to the Employer's use of such Payment Method(s) or applicable law. When the Employer authorizes a payment using a Payment Method via the Site, the Employer represents, warrants, and covenants that there are sufficient funds or credit available to complete the payment using the designated Payment Method. To the extent that any amounts owed under this Agreement cannot be collected from the Employer's Payment Method(s), the Employer is solely responsible for paying such amounts by other means. We reserve the right to seek reimbursement from you, and you will reimburse us, if we discover erroneous or duplicate transactions or we receive a chargeback from your Payment Method for any reason. You agree that we have the right to obtain such reimbursement by deducting amounts from future payments or withdrawals, charging your Payment Method(s), or obtaining reimbursement from you by any other lawful means. Without limiting any of our other rights or remedies, we may terminate your Account immediately upon your failure to reimburse us for chargebacks or other amounts owed under this Agreement.</p>

<h3>6.8   Payment Guarantee.</h3>

<p>Driver Hunt guarantees payment to Drivers if: (a) the Employer has a verified Payment Method, (b) the time represented is captured online using the Driver Hunt Team Software, (c) the Driver Services performed and recorded in the Time Log pertains directly to the Service Contract, and (d) each Time Log is annotated with descriptions of the Driver Services performed (the "Payment Guarantee"). Driver Hunt determines whether the foregoing criteria have been met at our sole discretion. Without limiting the foregoing, the Payment Guarantee does not apply to: (a) Drivers or Service Contracts in violation of this Agreement, (b) Drivers that do not meet the clear specifications of the Service Contract, (c) Drivers that are aware of or complicit in another User's violation of this Agreement, or (d) suspected or actual fraudulent activities or abuse of this Payment Guarantee.</p>

<h3>7. EXCLUSIVITY AND NON-CIRCUMVENTION.</h3>

<p>You acknowledge and agree that a substantial portion of the compensation Driver Hunt receives for making the Site available to you is collected as a deduction of the Finders Fee described in the foregoing subsection titled "Service Fee." Driver Hunt only deducts this Service Fee when a Employer and a Driver pay and receive payment through the Site. Therefore, for 24 months from the time you identify or are identified by any party through the Site (the "Exclusivity Period"), you must use the Site as your exclusive method to request, make, and receive all payments for work directly or indirectly with that party or arising out of your relationship with that party (the "Driver Hunt Relationship"). You may opt-out of this obligation only if Employer or prospective Employer pays Driver Hunt an "Opt-Out Fee" computed to be the greater of the following amounts:</p>

<ul>
      <li>£1500; or</li>
      <li>15% of the cost to the Employer of the services to be performed in the Driver Hunt Relationship during the Exclusivity Period, as estimated in good faith by the prospective Employer; or</li>
</ul>

<p>and, in any case, plus interest at the rate of 18% per annum or the maximum rate permitted by applicable law, whichever is less, calculated from the date Employer first makes payment to the subject Driver until the date the Opt-Out Fee is paid.</p>

<p>To pay the Opt-Out Fee, you must request instructions by sending an email message to optoutfee@driverhunt.com.</p>

<p>Non-Circumvention. You agree not to circumvent the Payment Methods offered by the Site. By way of illustration and not in limitation of the foregoing, you must not:</p>

<ul>
      <li>Submit proposals or solicit parties identified through the Site to contact, hire, manage, or pay outside the Site when contact details of the Driver have not been purchased by the Employer.</li>
      <li>Accept proposals or solicit parties identified through the Site to contact, deliver services, invoice, or receive payment outside the Site when contact details of the Driver have not been purchased by the Employer.</li>
      <li>You agree to notify Driver Hunt immediately if another person improperly contacts you or suggests making or receiving payments outside of the Site. If you are aware of a breach or potential breach of this non-circumvention policy, please submit a confidential report to Driver Hunt by sending an email message to: will@driverhunt.com.</li>
</ul>


<h3>8. SERVICE CONTRACT TERMS BETWEEN EMPLOYER AND DRIVER.</h3>

<p>Unless otherwise agreed to in a writing signed by both Employer and Driver and except for Service Contracts classified as employment relationships, the terms and conditions of the Service Contract that a Driver enters directly with a Employer when the Driver agrees to provide Services to the Employer are as set forth in this Section. Employer and Driver may not agree to any other terms and conditions that affect the rights or responsibilities of Driver Hunt. Driver Hunt is not a party to any Service Contract between Users, except as a Third-Party Beneficiary as described further below.</p>

<h2>8.9   Worker Classification.</h2>

<p>The Employer assumes all liability for determining whether Drivers are independent contractors or employees; Driver Hunt disclaims any liability for such determination. This Agreement does not create a partnership or agency relationship between The Employer and The Driver. The Driver does not have authority to enter into written or oral (whether implied or express) contracts on behalf of Employer. For Service Contracts classified as independent contractor relationships, Employer may not require an exclusive relationship between Employer and Driver. A Driver classified as independent contractor is free at all times to provide Driver Services to persons or businesses other than Employer, including any competitor of Employer.</p>

<h2>9.   Relationship with Driver Hunt.</h2>

<p>Driver Hunt is not party to the dealings between Employer and Driver. Driver Hunt makes the Site Services available to enable Drivers to identify and determine the suitability of Employers for themselves and to enable Employers to identify and determine the suitability of Drivers for themselves. Driver Hunt does not, in any way, supervise, direct, or control Drivers. Driver Hunt does not set Driver's work hours and location of work, nor is Driver Hunt involved in determining if the earnings will be set at an hourly or fixed rate for a Service Contract. Driver Hunt will not provide Driver with training or any equipment, labor, or materials needed for a particular Service Contract. Driver Hunt makes no representations about, and does not guarantee the quality, safety, or legality of, the Driver Services; the truth or accuracy of Driver's listings on the Site; the qualifications, background, or identities of Users; the ability of Drivers to deliver the Driver Services; the ability of Employers to pay for the Driver Services; or that a Employer or Driver can or will actually complete a transaction.</p>

<p>Driver Hunt does not deduct any amount for withholding, unemployment, Social Security, or other taxes for Employer or Driver; each of which is solely responsible for all tax returns and payments required to be filed with or made to any federal, state, or local tax authority in any nation with respect to Driver's performance, and Employer's acceptance, of Driver Services.</p>

<p>Driver Hunt is not required to and may not verify any information given to us by Drivers or Employers, nor does Driver Hunt perform background checks on Drivers or Employers. Driver Hunt may provide information about a Driver or Employer, such as a strength or risk score, geographical location, or verification of identity or credentials. However, such information is based solely on data that Driver or Employer submits to Driver Hunt, and Driver Hunt provides such information solely for the convenience of Users and is not an introduction, endorsement, or recommendation by Driver Hunt.</p>

<h2>10.   Third-Party Beneficiary.</h2>

<p>Employer and Driver acknowledge and agree that the value, reputation, and goodwill of the Site depend on their performance of their covenants and agreements in their Service Contract. Employer and Driver therefore appoint Driver Hunt as a third-party beneficiary of their Service Contracts for purposes of enforcing the obligations owed to, and the benefits conferred on, Driver Hunt by the Service Contracts. Employer and Driver further agree that Driver Hunt has the right to take such actions with respect to the Service Contracts or their Accounts, including, without limitation, suspension, termination, or legal actions, as Driver Hunt, in our sole discretion, deems necessary.</p>

<p>This Agreement and any Account registration will not be construed as creating or implying any relationship of agency, franchise, partnership, or joint venture between Users and Driver Hunt, except and solely to the extent expressly stated in this Agreement.</p>

<h2>11.   General.</h2>

<p>Service Contracts shall be governed by Sections 14 (Confidential Information), 11 (General), and 22 (Definitions) of this Agreement, as applicable, either directly or by way of analogy.</p>

<h3>11.1 Entire Agreement.</h3>

<p>The terms and conditions set forth in this Section 11 and any additional or different terms expressly agreed by Employer and Driver shall constitute the entire agreement and understanding of Employer and Driver with respect to each Service Contract and shall cancel and supersede any other prior or contemporaneous discussions, agreements, representations, warranties, and/or other communications between them.</p>

<h2>12.   DRIVERHUNT'S ROLE.</h2>

SOME JURISDICTIONS MAY NOT ALLOW FOR ALL OF THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS ON WARRANTIES, SO TO THAT EXTENT, SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

<h3>16.   LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</h3>

<p>IN NO EVENT WILL DRIVER HUNT, OUR AFFILIATES, OUR LICENSORS, OR OUR THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR INDIRECT COSTS OR DAMAGES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LITIGATION COSTS, INSTALLATION AND REMOVAL COSTS, OR LOSS OF DATA, PRODUCTION, PROFIT, OR BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES.

<h3>17.   RELEASE.</h3>

<p>In addition to the recognition that Driver Hunt is not a party to any contract between Employer and Driver, you hereby release Driver Hunt, our Affiliates, and our respective officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, joint ventures, and employees from claims, demands, and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with any dispute you have with another User, whether it be at law or in equity. This release includes, for example and without limitation, any disputes regarding the performance, functions, and quality of the Driver Services provided to Employer by a Driver and requests for refunds based upon disputes. Procedures regarding the handling of certain disputes between Users are discussed in subsection 8.4 (Dispute Resolution).</p>

<p>YOU HEREBY WAIVE CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE § 1542 (AND ANY ANALOGOUS LAW IN ANY OTHER APPLICABLE JURISDICTION WHICH SAYS: "A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.")</p>

<p>This release shall not apply to a claim that Driver Hunt failed to meet our obligations under this Agreement.</p>

<h3>18.   INDEMNIFICATION.</h3>

<p>You shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Driver Hunt, our Affiliates, and our respective directors, officers, employees, representatives, and agents (each an "Indemnified Party") from any and all claims, damages, liabilities, costs, losses, and expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees and all related costs and expenses) arising from or relating to any claim, suit, proceeding, demand, or action brought by a third party against an Indemnified Party relating to: (a) use of the Site and the Site Services by you or your agents, including any payment obligations incurred through use of the Site Services; (b) any Service Contract entered into by you or your agents, including, but not limited to, the classification of a Driver as an independent contractor; the classification of Driver Hunt as an employer or joint employer of Driver; any employment-related claims, such as those relating to employment termination, employment discrimination, harassment, or retaliation; and any claims for overtime pay, sick leave, holiday or vacation pay, retirement benefits, worker's compensation benefits, unemployment benefits, or any other employee benefits; (c) failure to comply with this Agreement by you or your agents; (d) failure to comply with applicable law by you or your agents; (e) negligence, willful misconduct, or fraud by you or your agents; and (f) libel, violation of privacy rights, unfair competition, or infringement of Proprietary Rights or allegations thereof to the extent caused by you or your agents.</p>

<h3>19.   TERM AND TERMINATION.</h3>

<p>This Agreement will become effective upon your first visit to the Site and will remain in effect for the duration of your use of the Site. Unless both you and Driver Hunt agree otherwise in writing, either of us may terminate the contract represented by this Agreement in our sole discretion, at any time, without explanation, upon written notice. If you are using Driver Hunt, you must legally terminate your relationship with the Employer or the Driver, as applicable, before terminating this Agreement. In the event you properly terminate this Agreement, your Account is automatically terminated; however, (i) if you have any open Jobs when you terminate this Agreement you will continue to be bound by this Agreement until all such Jobs have closed; (ii) Driver Hunt will continue to perform those services necessary to complete any open Job or related transaction between you and another Member; and (iii) you will continue to be obligated to pay any amounts accrued but unpaid as of the date of termination or as of the completion of any open Jobs, whichever is later, to Driver Hunt for any Site Services and to any Drivers for any Driver Services. Without limiting any other provisions of this Agreement, the termination of this Agreement for any reason will not release you, any Member with whom you have entered into a Member Contract, or Driver Hunt from any obligations incurred prior to termination of this Agreement or that thereafter may accrue in respect of any act or omission prior to such termination. Those Site Policies necessary to implement the foregoing survive termination of this Agreement for any reason.</p>

<p>Any termination of an Account will automatically lead to the termination of all related Agency Accounts, and upon any termination of an Agency Account, Driver Hunt may terminate any or all related Accounts and Agency Driver Accounts.</p>

<p>Without limiting Driver Hunt's other remedies, we may issue a warning or temporarily suspend, indefinitely suspend, or terminate your User access, Account, or a Job, and refuse to provide any or all Site Services to you if: (a) you breach the letter or spirit of any terms and conditions of this Agreement, other parts of the Terms of Service, or the linked policies and information incorporated herein by reference, including our written policies and procedures posted on the Site; (b) we suspect or become aware that you have provided false or misleading information to us; or (c) we believe, in our sole discretion, that your actions may cause legal liability for you, our Members, or Driver Hunt or our Affiliates; may be contrary to the interests of the Site or the User community; or may involve illicit activity. Once your Account is indefinitely suspended or terminated, you must not continue to use the Site under the same Account or a different Account or reregister under a new Account without Driver Hunt's prior written consent.</p>

<p>Without limiting Driver Hunt's other remedies, if you engage in actions or activities that circumvent the Site or otherwise reduce fees owed Driver Hunt or our Affiliates under this Agreement, you must pay Driver Hunt for all fees owed to Driver Hunt and our Affiliates and reimburse Driver Hunt for all losses and costs (including any and all time of Driver Hunt's employees) and reasonable expenses (including attorneys' fees) related to investigating such breach and collecting such fees. In addition, violations of this Agreement may be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and may result in additional penalties and sanctions.</p>

<p>We will notify you if we cancel your Account, unless we believe, in our sole judgment, that giving notice may cause further violation or damages. However, we will notify you that your Account will be canceled if applicable law requires such notification. You acknowledge and agree that the value, reputation, and goodwill of the Site depend on transparency of Member Account status to all Members, including both yourself and other Members who are participating in Jobs with you. You therefore agree as follows: IF DRIVER HUNT SUSPENDS OR TERMINATES YOUR ACCOUNT OR JOB, Driver Hunt HAS THE RIGHT BUT NOT THE OBLIGATION TO (1) NOTIFY OTHER MEMBERS ENGAGED IN ACTIVE JOBS WITH YOU TO INFORM THEM OF YOUR SUSPENDED OR TERMINATED ACCOUNT OR JOB STATUS, AND (2) PROVIDE THEM WITH SUMMARY REASONS FOR YOUR ACCOUNT SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION.</p>

<p>When your Account is terminated for any reason, you will no longer have access to data, messages, files, and other material you keep on the Site. If practicable, Driver Hunt will retain this information along with all your previous posts and proposals for a period of one year from the date of termination to give you ample time to institute an appeal our decision through the process described in the subsection titled "Disputes with Driver Hunt." If you appeal our decision through that process within one year, Driver Hunt will retain your information until such dispute is resolved. If you fail to appeal our decision within one year, Driver Hunt may delete your information including data, messages, files, and other material you keep on the Site.</p>

<h3>19.1 Enforcement of Agreement and Policies.</h3>

<p>Driver Hunt has the right, but not the obligation, to suspend or terminate your access to the Site and Site Services if we believe that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of this Agreement or violated our rights or those of another party. Without limiting Driver Hunt's other remedies, we may suspend or terminate your Account, use self-help in connection with our rights to reclaim funds, and refuse to provide any further access to the Site or the Services to you if (a) you breach any terms and conditions of this Agreement or other Terms of Service; (b) we are unable to verify or authenticate any information you provide to us; or (c) we believe that your actions may cause legal liability for you, other Users, or Driver Hunt. Once we suspend or terminate your Account, you may not access any parts of the Site, including data, messages, files, and other material saved on the Site and you may not continue to use the Site under a different Account or reregister under a new Account. If you attempt to use the Site under a different Account, we reserve the right to reclaim available funds in that Account and/or use an available Payment Method to pay for any amounts owed by you to the extent permitted by applicable law. You understand that any termination of your Account may involve deletion of any content stored in your Account for which Driver Hunt will have no liability whatsoever.</p>

<h3>19.2 Consequences of Termination.</h3>

<p>Termination of this Agreement or your Account shall not relieve the Employer of the requirement to pay for Driver Services performed prior to the effective date of the termination or thereafter for any Service Contracts executed before termination of this Agreement, which fees and expenses, together with any applicable taxes, the Employer hereby authorizes Driver Hunt to charge to its Payment Method pursuant to Section 6 (Payment Terms).</p>

<p>Except as otherwise required by applicable law, we will notify you if we terminate your Account, unless we believe, in our sole judgment, that giving notice may cause damage. You acknowledge and agree that the value, reputation, and goodwill of the Site depend on transparency of User's Account status to all Users, including both yourself and other Users who have entered into Service Contracts with you. You therefore agree as follows: IF Driver Hunt SUSPENDS OR TERMINATES YOUR ACCOUNT OR ANY RELATED SERVICE CONTRACTS, Driver Hunt HAS THE RIGHT BUT NOT THE OBLIGATION TO: (A) NOTIFY OTHER USERS THAT HAVE ENTERED INTO SERVICE CONTRACTS WITH YOU TO INFORM THEM OF YOUR SUSPENDED OR TERMINATED ACCOUNT STATUS, AND (B) PROVIDE THOSE MEMBERS WITH A SUMMARY OF THE REASONS FOR YOUR ACCOUNT SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION.</p>

<h3>19.3 Survival.</h3>

<p>Those terms that by their nature are intended to survive this Agreement shall survive this Agreement.</p>

<h2>20. CANCELLATIONS, REFUNDS, AND DISPUTES.</h2>

<h3>20.1 Dispute Process.</h3>

<p>You agree to abide by the Dispute Process in this document.</p>

<p>If a dispute arises between you and Driver Hunt or our Affiliates, our goal is to resolve the dispute quickly and cost-effectively. Accordingly, you, Driver Hunt, and our Affiliates agree to resolve any claim or controversy at law or equity that arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the Site Services (each, a "Claim") in accordance with this Section.</p>

<h3>20.2 Choice of Law and Forum for Disputes.</h3>

<p>This Agreement and any controversy, dispute, or claim between User and Driver Hunt or our Affiliates that arises out of or relates to this Agreement (each, a "Claim"), including without limitation any dispute relating to a Service Contract, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England, without regard to its conflict of law provisions and excluding the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG).</p>

<p>You agree that any Claim must be resolved as described in the subsections below titled "Informal Dispute Resolution" and "Mandatory Binding Arbitration and Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver."</p>

<h3>20.3 Informal Dispute Resolution.</h3>

<p>Before serving a demand for arbitration of a Claim, or otherwise seeking injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of law as expressly permitted in this Agreement, you agree to first notify Driver Hunt of the Claim at Attn: Legal, 56 Evans Lane, Kidlington, OX5 2HY (the "Notice") and seek informal resolution of the Claim. The Notice must include your name, pertinent account information, a brief description of the Claim, and your contact information, so that we may evaluate the Claim and attempt to informally resolve the Claim. Driver Hunt will have 60 days from the date of its receipt of the Notice to informally resolve the Claim, which, if successful, will avoid the need for further action.</p>

<h3>20.4 Mandatory Binding Arbitration and Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver (Does Not Apply to Drivers Located Outside the United Kingdom and Its Territories).</h3>

<p>This Mandatory Binding Arbitration and Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver provision ("Arbitration Provision") applies to all users except Drivers located outside of the United States and its territories.</p>

<p>In the unlikely event that Driver Hunt is unable to resolve a Claim within 60 days of its receipt of the Notice, you, Driver Hunt, and our Affiliates agree to resolve the Claim by binding arbitration before an arbitrator from JAMS. JAMS may be contacted at www.jamsinternational.com.</p>

<h3>A. Scope of Arbitration Agreement and Conduct of Arbitration.</h3>

<p>Arbitration as provided in this Mandatory Binding Arbitration and Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver provision ("Arbitration Provision") is governed by the United States Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1 et seq.). Except as otherwise stated in this Section, this Arbitration Provision applies to any legal dispute arising out of or related to your relationship with Driver Hunt (including any claimed employment with the Company or one of its Affiliates or successors) or termination of your relationship with Driver Hunt, regardless of the date of Claim accrual. This Arbitration Provision survives after your relationship with Driver Hunt ends. Except as it otherwise provides, this Arbitration Provision is intended to apply to the resolution of disputes that otherwise would be resolved in a court of law or before a forum other than arbitration. Except as otherwise stated in this Section, you and Driver Hunt agree that any legal dispute or controversy covered by this Arbitration Provision, or arising out of, relating to, or concerning the validity, enforceability or breach of this Arbitration Provision, will be resolved by binding arbitration administered by JAMS. If for any reason JAMS will not administer the arbitration, either party may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction with authority over the location where the arbitration will be conducted for appointment of a neutral Arbitrator.</p>

<p>Except as otherwise provided herein, arbitration will be conducted in Santa Clara County, California in accordance with the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect for JAMS. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Claims or disputes by Drivers that allege employment or worker classification claims will be conducted within 25 miles of where the Driver is located in accordance with the JAMS Employment Arbitration Rules and Procedures then in effect. The JAMS arbitration rules may be found at www.jamsadr.com or by searching online for "JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures" or "JAMS Employment Arbitration Rules." The parties agree that any party will have the right to appear at the arbitration by telephone and/or video rather than in person.</p>

<p>Except as it otherwise provides, this Arbitration Provision applies, without limitation, to all disputes arising out of or related to your relationship with Driver Hunt or the termination of that relationship, any payments you claim due you from Driver Hunt, trade secrets, unfair competition, compensation, classification, minimum wage, seating, expense reimbursement, overtime, breaks and rest periods, termination, discrimination or harassment and claims arising under the Uniform Trade Secrets Act, Civil Rights Act of 1964, Americans With Disabilities Act, Age Discrimination in Employment Act, Family Medical Leave Act, Fair Labor Standards Act, Employee Retirement Income Security Act (except for claims for employee benefits under any benefit plan sponsored by the Company and (a) covered by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 or (b) funded by insurance), Affordable Care Act, Genetic Information Non-Discrimination Act, state statutes or regulations addressing the same or similar subject matters, and all other federal or state legal claims arising out of or relating to your relationship with Driver Hunt or the termination of that relationship.</p>

<p>You and Driver Hunt will follow the applicable JAMS rules with respect to arbitration fees. In any arbitration under the JAMS Employment Arbitration Rules and Procedures, the Driver will pay JAMS arbitration fees only to the extent those fees are no greater than the filing or initial appearance fees applicable to court actions in the jurisdiction where the arbitration will be conducted. The arbitrator must follow applicable law and may award only those remedies that would have applied had the matter been heard in court. Judgment may be entered on the arbitrator's decision in any court having jurisdiction.</p>

<p>This Arbitration Provision does not apply to litigation between the Company and you to which you are a party that is already pending in a state or federal court as of the effective date of this Arbitration Provision. This Arbitration Provision also does not apply to claims for workers compensation, state disability insurance or unemployment insurance benefits. Either you or Driver Hunt may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for temporary or preliminary injunctive relief in connection with an arbitrable controversy, but only upon the ground that the award to which that party may be entitled may be rendered ineffectual without such relief. Notwithstanding this Arbitration Provision, you and Driver Hunt retain the right to bring an action in small claims court within the jurisdictional limits of the small claims court and as long as such matter is only pending in that court.</p>

<p>Regardless of any other terms of this Arbitration Provision, a claim may be brought before and remedies awarded by an administrative agency if applicable law permits the agency to adjudicate the claim notwithstanding the existence of this agreement to arbitrate. Such administrative claims include without limitation claims or charges brought before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the U.S. Department of Labor, or the National Labor Relations Board. Nothing in this Arbitration Provision shall be deemed to preclude or excuse a party from bringing an administrative claim before any agency in order to fulfill the party's obligation to exhaust administrative remedies before making a claim in arbitration.</p>

<p>Disputes that may not be subject to a pre-dispute arbitration agreement as provided by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Public Law 111-203) are excluded from the coverage of this Arbitration Provision.</p>

<h3>B. Enforcement of this Arbitration Provision.</h3>

<p>This Arbitration Provision is the full and complete agreement relating to the formal resolution of disputes covered by this Arbitration Provision. In the event any portion of this Arbitration Provision is deemed unenforceable, the remainder of this Arbitration Provision will be enforceable. If the Class Action Waiver in subsection C, below, of this Arbitration Provision is deemed to be unenforceable, you and Driver Hunt agree that this Arbitration Provision is otherwise silent as to any party's ability to bring a class, collective or representative action in arbitration.</p>

<h3>C. Class Action and Jury Trial Waiver.</h3>

<p>THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION AFFECTS YOUR ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN CLASS, COLLECTIVE OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS. BOTH YOU AND Driver Hunt AGREE TO BRING ANY DISPUTE IN ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS ONLY, AND NOT ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL REPRESENTATIVE BASIS ON BEHALF OF OTHERS. THERE WILL BE NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE BROUGHT, HEARD OR ARBITRATED AS A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR AS A MEMBER IN ANY SUCH CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL PROCEEDING ("CLASS ACTION WAIVER"). THE CLASS ACTION WAIVER DOES NOT APPLY TO ANY CLAIM YOU BRING AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL SOLELY ON YOUR OWN BEHALF AND NOT ON BEHALF OF OTHERS. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PORTION OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION OR THE JAMS RULES, DISPUTES REGARDING THE VALIDITY, ENFORCEABILITY OR BREACH OF THE CLASS ACTION WAIVER MAY BE RESOLVED ONLY BY A CIVIL COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION AND NOT BY AN ARBITRATOR. IN ANY CASE IN WHICH (1) THE DISPUTE IS FILED AS A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION AND (2) A CIVIL COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION FINDS ALL OR PART OF THE CLASS ACTION WAIVER UNENFORCEABLE, THE CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE AND/OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION TO THAT EXTENT MUST BE LITIGATED IN A CIVIL COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION, BUT THE PORTION OF THE CLASS ACTION WAIVER THAT IS ENFORCEABLE SHALL BE ENFORCED IN ARBITRATION. YOU AND Driver Hunt AGREE THAT YOU WILL NOT BE RETALIATED AGAINST, DISCIPLINED OR THREATENED WITH DISCIPLINE AS A RESULT OF EXERCISING YOUR RIGHTS UNDER SECTION 7 OF THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS ACT BY FILING OR PARTICIPATING IN A CLASS, COLLECTIVE OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION IN ANY FORUM. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY MAY LAWFULLY SEEK ENFORCEMENT OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION AND THE CLASS ACTION WAIVER UNDER THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT AND SEEK DISMISSAL OF SUCH CLASS, COLLECTIVE OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS OR CLAIMS. THE CLASS ACTION WAIVER SHALL BE SEVERABLE IN ANY CASE IN WHICH THE DISPUTE IS FILED AS AN INDIVIDUAL ACTION, AND SEVERANCE IS NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT THE INDIVIDUAL ACTION PROCEEDS IN ARBITRATION.</p>

<h3>D. Right to Opt Out of Arbitration and Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver.</h3>

<p>You may opt out of the foregoing arbitration and class action/jury trial waiver provision of this Agreement by notifying Driver Hunt in writing within 30 days of the date you first registered for the Site. To opt out, you must send a written notification to Driver Hunt at Attn: Legal, 56 Evans Lane, Kidlington, England, OX5 2HY that includes (a) your account username, (b) your name, (c) your address, (d) your telephone number, (e) your email address, and (f) a clear statement indicating that you do not wish to resolve claims through arbitration and demonstrating compliance with the 30-day time limit to opt out of the above arbitration and class action/jury trial waiver provisions.</p>

<h2>21.   GENERAL.</h2>

<h3>21.1  Entire Agreement.</h3>

<p>This Agreement, together with the other Terms of Service and any other legal notices and agreements published by Driver Hunt on the Site, sets forth the entire agreement and understanding between you and Driver Hunt relating to the subject matter hereof and thereof and cancels and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous discussions, agreements, representations, warranties, and other communications between you and us, written or oral, to the extent they relate in any way to the subject matter hereof and thereof. The section headings in this Agreement are included for ease of reference only and have no binding effect. Even though Driver Hunt drafted this Agreement, you represent that you had ample time to review and decide whether to agree to the terms of this Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation of this Agreement arises, no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring you or Driver Hunt because of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement.</p>

<h3>21.2  Side Agreements.</h3>

<p>Notwithstanding subsection 21.1 (Entire Agreement), Employers and Drivers may enter into any supplemental or other written agreements that they deem appropriate (e.g., confidentiality agreements, work for hire agreements, assignment of rights, etc.). The terms and conditions of this Agreement, however, will govern and supersede any term or condition in a side agreement that purports to expand Driver Hunt's obligations or restrict Driver Hunt's rights under this Agreement.</p>

<h3>21.3  Compliance.</h3>

<p>User shall not violate any applicable foreign, federal, state, or local laws or third-party rights on or related to the Site. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, User agrees to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, import and export control laws and third parties' Proprietary Rights.</p>

<h3>21.4  Modifications.</h3>

<p>No modification or amendment to this Agreement shall be binding upon Driver Hunt unless in a written instrument signed by a duly authorized representative of Driver Hunt. For the purposes of this subsection, a written instrument shall expressly exclude electronic communications, such as email and electronic notices, but shall include facsimiles.</p>

<h3>21.5  No Waiver.</h3>

<p>The failure or delay of either party to exercise or enforce any right or claim does not constitute a waiver of such right or claim and shall in no way affect that party's right to later enforce or exercise it, unless such party issues an express written waiver, signed by a duly authorized representative of such party.</p>

<h3>21.6  Assignability.</h3>

<p>User may not assign this Agreement, or any of its rights or obligations hereunder, without Driver Hunt's prior written consent in the form of a written instrument signed by a duly authorized representative of Driver Hunt (and, for the purposes of this subsection, a written instrument shall expressly exclude electronic communications such as email and electronic notices, but shall include facsimiles). Driver Hunt may freely assign this Agreement without User's consent. Any attempted assignment or transfer in violation of this subsection will be null and void. Subject to the foregoing restrictions, this Agreement will inure to the benefit of the successors and permitted assigns of the parties.p</p>

<h3>21.7  Severability.</h3>

<p>If and to the extent any provision of this Agreement is held illegal, invalid, or unenforceable in whole or in part under applicable law, such provision or such portion thereof shall be ineffective as to the jurisdiction in which it is illegal, invalid, or unenforceable to the extent of its illegality, invalidity, or unenforceability and shall be deemed modified to the extent necessary to conform to applicable law so as to give the maximum effect to the intent of the parties. The illegality, invalidity, or unenforceability of such provision in that jurisdiction shall not in any way affect the legality, validity, or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction or of any other provision in any jurisdiction.</p>

<h3>21.8  Choice of Law.</h3>

<p>This Agreement and any controversy, dispute, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement between User and Driver Hunt or our Affiliates, including, but not limited to, a Service Contract (each, a "Claim"), shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of law provisions and excluding the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG); provided, however, that any Claims made by any Driver located within the United States will be governed by the law of the state in which such Driver resides.</p>

<p>You agree that any Claim must be resolved as described in the subsections below titled "Informal Dispute Resolution" and "Mandatory Binding Arbitration and Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver."</p>

<h3>21.9  Force Majeure.</h3>

<p>The parties to this Agreement will not be responsible for the failure to perform or any delay in performance of any obligation hereunder due to labor disturbances, accidents, fires, floods, telecommunications or Internet failures, strikes, wars, riots, rebellions, blockades, acts of government, governmental requirements and regulations or restrictions imposed by law or any other similar conditions beyond the reasonable control of such party. The time for performance of such party will be extended by the period of such delay. Irrespective of any extension of time, if an Event of Force Majeure occurs and its effect continues for a period of 60 days, either the party may give to the other a 30-day notice of termination. If, at the end of the 30 day period, the effect of the Force Majeure continues, the Contract shall terminate.</p>

<h3>21.10 Prevailing Language and Location.</h3>

<p>The English language version of this Agreement shall be controlling in all respects and shall prevail in case of any inconsistencies with translated versions, if any. The Site is controlled and operated from our facilities in the United Kingdom. Driver Hunt makes no representations that the Site is appropriate or available for use in other locations. Those who access or use the Site from other jurisdictions do so at their own volition and are entirely responsible for compliance with all applicable foreign, United Kingdom, state, and local laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, export and import regulations, including the Export Administration Regulations maintained by the United Kingdom Department of Commerce and the sanctions programs maintained by the Department of the Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control.
